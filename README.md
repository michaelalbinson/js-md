## Javascript Markdown
I like Markdown, I write Markdown, I'm writing a markdown transpiler. Just for kicks.

I also don't like spurious npm dependencies. So I wrote a pure JS no-dependency Markdown parser.
No dependencies, no nonsense, plug and play - just the way it should be. 

### Usage
In the browser:
```javascript

```

In node:
```javascript

```
